My conclusions during coding
12.03.2020

Goal was to write additional block to mass_algo_classif_function, to make Feature Selection base on the feat_importance.
From 8 models, startartize block managed to do only for 3-4 of them.
Reasons: KNN has no feat_importance, CATBoost, Gaussian and SVM.SVC as well required peculiar approach.
Conclusion: 
1. Make separate feature selection after model defined

Finished and uploaded first draft of Corona_prediction

Future steps:
1. MOre models and tune
2. Check prediction
3. Prediction for more countries
4. Go through another Kernel.Check logic!

Preventive Maint
1. Score improved by drop y=['ttf'] - 5% min and max
2. Why predicted is beter than av.Std is equal.
Recalculate to RSME and will see

3. Drop colin feat improved score (even best RF) (Done)

4. Graph for Predicted/Actual (Done)

5. Control Outliars by Z_score (Done)

31.03

Instruction for Outliars Detection and Normality Check (Done)

01.03
Binary classification
1. Predict_proba (2 columns - probability to belong one of classes) and 
decision function (if no predict_proba, posotive- class 1, neg - class 0)

2. Why Predict_proba but not just prediction - used to define threshold at which we should switch from 0 to 1


02.03
Multiclass classification
1. Prepare y - transform to binary classificaton - LabelBinaliazer
2. Function with GridSearch to calc y_pred or y_score
3. Metrics calculare
4. Precision-Recall Curve to STUDY!
