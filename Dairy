My conclusions during coding
12.03.2020

Goal was to write additional block to mass_algo_classif_function, to make Feature Selection base on the feat_importance.
From 8 models, startartize block managed to do only for 3-4 of them.
Reasons: KNN has no feat_importance, CATBoost, Gaussian and SVM.SVC as well required peculiar approach.
Conclusion: 
1. Make separate feature selection after model defined

Finished and uploaded first draft of Corona_prediction

Future steps:
1. MOre models and tune
2. Check prediction
3. Prediction for more countries
4. Go through another Kernel.Check logic!

Preventive Maint
1. Score improved by drop y=['ttf'] - 5% min and max
2. Why predicted is beter than av.Std is equal.
Recalculate to RSME and will see

3. Graph for Predicted/Actual
